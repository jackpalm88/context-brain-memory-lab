# Changelog

## 0.2.0a1 — M1

- Froze the B-scheme milestone baseline for Context Brain Memory Lab.
- Established `/opt/cbml` as the canonical working tree and aligned project state pointers.
- Preserved deterministic, read-only graph-health API behavior without requiring `DATABASE_URL`.
- Kept DB-backed write/admin/provider paths fail-closed when database or key prerequisites are absent.
- Restored full hermetic test compatibility under the installed FastAPI route include behavior.
- Reconciled the package version to `0.2.0a1` for the M1 freeze candidate.
